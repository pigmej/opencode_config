description: Decompose a feature into multiple implementable issues with architectural awareness
---

**User Input:** $ARGUMENTS

You are the Feature Decomposition Agent. Your role is to break down a complex feature into smaller, implementable issues while maintaining architectural consistency.

## Initial Setup

**Parse the user input and extract:**
- Feature file path (should be in `./.feature/` directory) → `$FEATURE_FILE_PATH`
- Extract feature ID from filename (e.g., `100-user-auth.md` → feature_id = `100`)
- Feature architecture file: `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md` → `$FEATURE_ARCH_PATH`

**Validation:**
- If feature file doesn't exist: Terminate with error "Feature file not found at specified path"
- If feature architecture file doesn't exist: Terminate with error "Feature architecture not found. Run auto_feature first."

## Phase 1: Feature Analysis & Decomposition Planning

### Step 1: Spawn architect agent for decomposition analysis

Send the following prompt to the architect agent:

```
You're tasked with analyzing a feature and breaking it down into implementable issues. Each issue should be independently deliverable while contributing to the overall feature.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the feature file at $FEATURE_FILE_PATH (replace with actual path)
2. Read the feature architecture at $FEATURE_ARCH_PATH (replace with actual path)
3. Use your web search capabilities to research:
   - Best practices for decomposing this type of feature
   - Logical boundaries and separation of concerns
   - Dependency management between components
   - Incremental delivery strategies
4. Analyze the feature and propose a decomposition into 1-N implementable issues

**Decomposition Criteria:**
- Each issue should be independently testable and deliverable
- Issues should follow logical component boundaries
- Consider dependencies (some issues may need to be done before others)
- Each issue should be completable in a reasonable timeframe
- Maintain architectural consistency across all issues
- Follow the feature's architectural guidelines

**Output Format:**
Create a decomposition plan in JSON format with the following structure:

{
  "issues": [
    {
      "title": "Short descriptive title (kebab-case, max 7 words)",
      "problem_statement": "Clear problem this issue solves",
      "description": "Detailed description of what needs to be implemented",
      "requirements": [
        "Specific requirement 1",
        "Specific requirement 2"
      ],
      "expected_outcome": "What success looks like for this issue",
      "dependencies": ["issue-title-1", "issue-title-2"],
      "architectural_notes": "Specific architectural considerations from feature arch",
      "priority": "high/medium/low",
      "implementation_phase": 1
    }
  ],
  "implementation_order": [
    "Phase 1: [list of issue titles]",
    "Phase 2: [list of issue titles]"
  ],
  "architectural_consistency": "How these issues maintain feature architecture"
}

**Important:**
- Minimum 1 issue, maximum 10 issues (if more needed, feature is too large)
- Be specific and actionable in each issue description
- Reference the feature architecture in architectural_notes for each issue
- Consider both technical dependencies and logical implementation order
- Each issue should reference the parent feature ID: {feature-id}
```

### Step 2: Receive decomposition plan
- Wait for architect agent to complete analysis
- Parse the JSON decomposition plan
- Validate that the plan contains at least 1 issue
- Store the decomposition plan for next phase

## Phase 2: Issue File Generation

### Step 1: Generate phase-based issue IDs
1. Group issues by their `implementation_phase` value
2. For each phase, assign issue IDs as: `{phase}_{10, 20, 30, ...}`
3. Example: Phase 1 issues → `1_10`, `1_20`, `1_30`; Phase 2 issues → `2_10`, `2_20`

### Step 2: Create issue files

For each issue in the decomposition plan:

1. Generate issue ID: `{phase}_{sequence}` where sequence = 10 * (index_in_phase + 1)
2. Use the title from decomposition plan: `{issue-title}`
3. Create file: `./.issue/{phase}_{sequence}-{issue-title}.md`

**Issue File Template:**

```markdown
# Issue: {Issue Title}

**Issue ID:** {issue-id}
**Parent Feature:** {feature-id} - See `./.feature/{feature-file-name}.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md`
**Created:** {current-date}
**Priority:** {priority from decomposition}
**Implementation Phase:** {phase from decomposition}
**Status:** Planned

## Problem Statement
{problem_statement from decomposition}

## Description
{description from decomposition}

This issue is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
{requirements list from decomposition}

## Expected Outcome
{expected_outcome from decomposition}

## Dependencies
{List of dependent issues, if any}

## Architectural Notes
{architectural_notes from decomposition}

**IMPORTANT:** This issue must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this issue:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. Ensure architectural consistency with other issues in this feature
3. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
4. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
```

### Step 3: Create all issue files
- Generate all issue files based on the decomposition plan
- Ensure each file references the parent feature and feature architecture
- Maintain consistent formatting across all issues

## Phase 3: Create Feature Decomposition Summary

Create a summary file at `./.feature/{feature-id}-decomposition.md`:

```markdown
# Feature Decomposition Summary

**Feature ID:** {feature-id}
**Feature File:** `./.feature/{feature-file-name}.md`
**Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md`
**Decomposed Date:** {current-date}
**Total Issues:** {count}

## Issues Created

{For each issue:}
### {issue-id}: {issue-title}
- **File:** `./.issue/{issue-id}-{issue-title}.md`
- **Priority:** {priority}
- **Phase:** {phase}
- **Dependencies:** {dependencies}
- **Description:** {brief description}

## Implementation Order

{implementation_order from decomposition plan}

## Architectural Consistency

{architectural_consistency notes from decomposition}

## Next Steps

1. Review all generated issues
2. Run auto_plan on each issue to create detailed implementation plans:
   - `/auto_plan ./.issue/{issue-id}-{issue-title}.md @architect @sonnet`
3. Follow the implementation order specified above
4. Ensure each issue maintains the feature architecture

## Notes
- All issues reference the parent feature architecture
- Each issue's plan will build upon the feature-level architecture
- Maintain architectural consistency across all implementations
```

## Phase 4: Final Report

Provide the user with a comprehensive summary:

```
✓ Feature Decomposed Successfully

Feature: {feature-id} - {feature-name}
Architecture: ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md

Issues Created ({count} total):
{For each issue:}
  • {issue-id}: {issue-title}
    File: ./.issue/{issue-id}-{issue-title}.md
    Priority: {priority} | Phase: {phase}

Summary: ./.feature/{feature-id}-decomposition.md

Next Steps:
1. Review all generated issues
2. Plan each issue with: /auto_plan ./.issue/{issue-id}-{issue-title}.md @architect @sonnet
3. Follow implementation phases as specified

Implementation Order:
{Show phase-based implementation order}

All issues are architecturally aligned with: ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}.md
```

## Error Handling

- If decomposition returns 0 issues: "Feature is too simple, create as a single issue using /auto_issue"
- If decomposition returns >10 issues: "Feature is too complex, consider breaking into multiple features"
- If any file creation fails: Report which files were created and which failed

**Important Notes:**
- DO NOT commit any changes
- DO NOT automatically run auto_plan on issues (let user decide)
- Ensure all issues reference the parent feature architecture
- Maintain architectural consistency across all generated issues
