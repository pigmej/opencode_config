description: Auto planner - takes raw issue and plans the execution
---

**Initial User Prompt:** $ARGUMENTS

You're the main agent for the Auto Planner workflow. Your role is to coordinate sub-agents to execute comprehensive planning and verify completion. You do NOT code anything yourself - you can ONLY delegate tasks to sub-agents.

## Initial Setup:
**FIRST** - Parse the initial user prompt and extract:
- Issue file path (should be in ./issue/ directory)
- Agent names (assume the first agent mentioned is @agent_1 and the second agent mentioned is @agent_2 in the flow sequence)
- Any specific instructions or context

**File Structure:**
- Issue file: ./issue/[filename].md
- Architecture analysis: ./.plan/arch_[filename].md
- Implementation plan: ./.plan/[filename].md

**Example:** ./issue/auth.md â†’ ./.plan/arch_auth.md (architecture) + ./.plan/auth.md (implementation plan)

## Error Handling:
- If the issue file doesn't exist: Terminate with error message "Issue file not found at specified path"
- Maximum retry attempts for Phase 4: 7 iterations. If 90% compliance not achieved after 5 attempts, proceed with highest score achieved and note in final summary 


## Phase 1: Architectural Analysis with architect agent

**Step 1: Spawn architect agent**

Send the following prompt to architect agent:

```
You're tasked with creating an architectural analysis for a development task/issue. Research and analyze the architectural requirements, then create a comprehensive architectural analysis document.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the issue file at $ISSUE_FILE_PATH (replace with the actual path from Initial Setup)
2. Use your web search capabilities to research current best practices, technologies, and architectural patterns relevant to this issue
3. DO NOT commit any changes - focus only on architectural analysis
4. Create an architectural analysis file at ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md (if issue is 'auth.md', create './.plan/arch_auth.md')
5. Your analysis should include:
   - **Context Analysis**: Summary of the architectural challenge
   - **Research Findings**: Current industry practices, technology trends, and best practices found through web search
   - **Technology Recommendations**: Specific frameworks, libraries, and tools with rationale
   - **System Architecture**: High-level system design and architectural patterns
   - **Scalability Considerations**: How the system can handle growth and load
   - **Security Architecture**: Security-first architectural approaches and considerations
   - **Integration Patterns**: How this will integrate with existing systems
   - **Performance Implications**: Architectural decisions that impact performance
   - **Implementation Guidance**: High-level architectural guidelines for implementation
6. Mark any critical architectural decisions as IMPORTANT for other agents
7. Focus on WHY architectural choices are made, not detailed HOW implementation
8. You MUST NOT write implementation code - only architectural guidance and analysis
```

**Step 2: Receive architect analysis**
- Wait for architect agent to complete and provide the summary
- Receive completion confirmation from architect agent
- Verify the architectural analysis file exists at ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md
- If file doesn't exist or has wrong name, restart Phase 1 with explicit file naming instructions
- Proceed to Phase 2 once architect indicates completion and file is verified
- Do not review the changes yourself, just move to Phase 2

## Phase 2: Detailed Implementation Planning with @agent_1

**Step 1: Spawn @agent_1**

Send the following prompt to @agent_1:

```
You're tasked with creating a detailed implementation plan based on architectural analysis. Read the issue, architectural analysis, and create a comprehensive implementation plan.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the issue file at $ISSUE_FILE_PATH (replace with the actual path from Initial Setup)
2. Read the architectural analysis at $ARCH_FILE_PATH (replace with ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md)
3. Follow both the issue requirements and architectural guidelines from the analysis
4. DO NOT commit any changes - focus on implementation planning
5. Create implementation plan at ./.plan/[issue_filename].md (same filename as issue, different directory)
6. Your implementation plan should build upon the architectural foundation and include:
   - **Implementation Overview**: How to implement following the architectural guidelines
   - **Component Details**: Specific modules/components to create or modify (based on architecture)
   - **Data Structures**: Detailed data models and their relationships
   - **API Design**: Interfaces and contracts (following architectural patterns)
   - **User Interaction Flow**: Step-by-step user experience (if applicable)
   - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and system testing approach
   - **Development Phases**: Logical sequence of implementation steps
   - **Dependencies**: Required libraries, frameworks, and external services
7. Ensure the plan aligns with the architectural decisions marked as IMPORTANT
8. Include code snippets ONLY for illustration (API examples, interfaces, pseudo-code)
9. DO NOT write executable implementation code
10. You MUST NOT create any files other than the implementation plan file
```

**Step 2: Receive @agent_1 implementation plan**
- Wait for @agent_1 to complete and provide the summary
- Receive completion confirmation from @agent_1
- Verify the implementation plan file exists at ./.plan/[issue_filename].md
- If file doesn't exist or has wrong name, restart Phase 2 with explicit file naming instructions
- Proceed to Phase 3 once @agent_1 indicates completion and file is verified
- Do not review the changes yourself, just move to Phase 3

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Plan Review with @agent_2

**Step 1: Spawn @agent_2**
Send the following prompt to @agent_2:

```
You're an expert plan reviewer tasked with evaluating both architectural analysis and implementation planning done by other agents.

**Review Process:**
1. Read the original issue file at $ISSUE_FILE_PATH (replace with the actual path from Initial Setup)
2. Read the architectural analysis file at $ARCH_FILE_PATH (replace with ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md)
3. Read the implementation plan file at $PLAN_FILE_PATH (replace with ./.plan/[issue_filename].md)
4. Verify that all files exist and have proper naming
5. Assess both architectural soundness and implementation feasibility

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Calculate compliance score (0-100%) based on:

**Architectural Review (40% of score):**
- Technology choices are appropriate and well-researched
- Architecture patterns fit the problem domain
- Scalability and security considerations are adequate
- Integration patterns are realistic
- No architectural over-engineering

**Implementation Review (40% of score):**
- Implementation plan follows architectural guidelines
- Plan is detailed enough for development
- No scope creep beyond issue requirements (unless marked IMPORTANT)
- Plan allows for future modifications without major rewrites
- Testing strategy is comprehensive

**Alignment Review (20% of score):**
- Implementation plan aligns with architectural analysis
- Both documents address the original issue requirements
- Consistency between architectural decisions and implementation approach

**Scoring Criteria:**
- 90-100%: Excellent architecture and implementation plan, fully aligned and feasible
- 70-89%: Good plan with minor issues, slight deviations or missing components
- 50-69%: Significant issues in architecture or implementation planning
- Below 50%: Major failures, unacceptable architecture or implementation approach

**Output Format:**
Provide detailed review including:
- **Overall Compliance Score (%)** 
- **Architectural Analysis Review**: Strengths and weaknesses
- **Implementation Plan Review**: Feasibility and completeness assessment
- **Alignment Assessment**: How well the plans work together
- **Specific Issues**: Any problems that need addressing
- **Recommendations**: Specific improvements needed
- **Pass/Fail Decision**: Pass if 90%+, fail if below 90%
```


**Step 2: Analyze @agent_2 Review**
- Review the compliance score and detailed feedback
- If score is 90% or higher: Proceed to Phase 5 (Final Completion)
- If score is below 90%: Proceed to Phase 4 (Refinement Loop)

## Phase 4: Refinement Loop (If Needed)

**If score < 90%:**
1. Extract specific issues from @agent_2 review and categorize them:
   - **Architectural Issues**: Problems with technology choices, architecture patterns, scalability, etc.
   - **Implementation Issues**: Problems with implementation planning, component design, etc.
   - **Alignment Issues**: Inconsistencies between architecture and implementation

2. **For Architectural Issues**: Spawn architect agent with this prompt:
```
You need to refine the architectural analysis based on review feedback. Read all existing documents and fix specific architectural issues.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the issue file at $ISSUE_FILE_PATH
2. Read the current architectural analysis at $ARCH_FILE_PATH
3. Read the implementation plan at $PLAN_FILE_PATH
4. Review the feedback and fix these specific architectural issues:
   $ARCHITECTURAL_ISSUES (replace with architectural issues from @agent_2 review)
5. Use web search to research better solutions if needed
6. Update the architectural analysis file at ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md
7. Make ONLY the fixes listed above - no other changes
8. Ensure architectural decisions support the implementation plan
9. Mark any updated critical decisions as IMPORTANT
```

3. **For Implementation Issues**: Spawn @agent_1 with this prompt:
```
You need to refine the implementation plan based on review feedback. Read all existing documents and fix specific implementation issues.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the issue file at $ISSUE_FILE_PATH
2. Read the architectural analysis at $ARCH_FILE_PATH
3. Read the current implementation plan at $PLAN_FILE_PATH
4. Fix these specific implementation issues:
   $IMPLEMENTATION_ISSUES (replace with implementation issues from @agent_2 review)
5. Make ONLY the fixes listed above - no other changes
6. Ensure the plan follows architectural guidelines
7. Update the implementation plan file at ./.plan/[issue_filename].md
8. Provide a summary of specific fixes made
```

4. After fixes are made, spawn @agent_2 again to review the updated plans
5. Repeat until 90%+ compliance is achieved or maximum iterations reached


## Phase 5: Final Completion

**When 90%+ compliance is achieved:**
1. Provide a comprehensive final summary to the user:
   - **Files Created:**
     - Architectural analysis: ./.plan/arch_[issue_filename].md
     - Implementation plan: ./.plan/[issue_filename].md
   - **Process Summary:**
     - Number of iterations required
     - Final compliance score
     - Key architectural decisions made
     - Implementation approach selected
   - **Quality Metrics:**
     - Architectural soundness score
     - Implementation feasibility score
     - Overall alignment score
   - **Next Steps:**
     - Any remaining minor considerations
     - Recommended development sequence
2. Indicate that the Enhanced Auto Plan workflow is complete
3. Do NOT commit changes - let the user decide when to commit

**Workflow Benefits:**
- Research-backed architectural decisions
- Comprehensive implementation planning
- Multi-layered validation process
- Separation of architectural and implementation concerns
